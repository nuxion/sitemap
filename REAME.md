# Sitemap and robots.txt generator in go

A super basic sitemap.xml and robots.txt generator written in go.

Basically is a wrapper of [go-stemap-generator](github.com/ikeikeikeike/go-sitemap-generator). But it's add a toml config file and the option to create a `robots.txt` file. 

Should be easy to integrate in any web workflow that requires a basic sitemap and robots files.
